# Biography

I am a computer and information technology professional. I got my start in technology working for small custom computer shops back in late ninties. In early 2000 I moved on to Systems Administration for small networks. I got tired with the corporate world and start providing [services](../professional/services/index.html) to the public in Santa Rosa. Today I still provide IT services to the public in Santa Rosa, California while I work on decentralizing governance writing and reseach projects.

Along the way I during 9/11 I became concerned with the power de facto centralized governments wields against it's people and started working on [ideas](../activism/greatwork/index.html) that would free us from the tyranny that these institutions disguise as beneficial actions for the good of humanity.
