# Biography

I am a computer and information technology professional. I got my start in technology working for small custom computer shops back in the eighties. I moved on to Systems Administration for small networks. Eventually I moved on to providing my own services in Information Technology and Security, Web Services Administration and Content Development.

Along the way I during 9/11 I became concerned with the power de facto centralized governments wields against it's people and started working on [ideas](../greatwork/index.html) that would free us from the tyranny that these institutions disguise as beneficial actions for the good of humanity.
