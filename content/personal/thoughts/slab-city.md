## Off grid thoughts

To my friends and customers. I have grown weary with living in our current society. The reasons are complex but over the years I have discovered many untruths about what I been told about many facets of how society is run. I had a awakening after reading "<a href="https://scottrlarson.github.io/activism/commonwealths/document/end-of-all-evil.html">The end of all evil</a>" which basically sums up the qualities society is based on. I want to live in a better world, in order to do that I can no longer contribute to the problems in society by being part of it.
So, I have been researching places to go where I will be outside the current machines of society. I am researching how to travel, live and stay safe in <a href="http://www.theplaidzebra.com/the-last-free-place-in-america/">Slab City</a>. Some may say you can never really extract yourself from the problem totally and that you will end up relying on the system somehow. Mabel that's true... The point really is that for me to make a positive contribution to people by involving myself in centralized government as little as possible. Freedom is a gift, to allow any person or system take that away for any reason is harmful to everyone.

I do not plan on being in civilization as we know it in 2018. I hope to be off-grid by then.

## Off grid update

I wish I could say that I will for sure be off grid by 2018. For family reasons this may not happen as I want it to happen. I am still researching a searching for my options. The idea still is to live/build an [earthship](http://earthship.com) that is completely sustainable and living off-grid, but I am not sure when this is going to happen now as I have to weigh my options.
