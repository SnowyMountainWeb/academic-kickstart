Spoke to: Chastity - supposed supervisor

The issue is that I changed the cc card on file and made a payment for august with a customer service rep he asked me to call *233 which I did to setup automated bill pay it did not go though . The automated system connected me to a rep. The rep that asked me for the billing zip code I gave her the new the zip code for the credit card number I changed with the last rep. The rep asked me again the billing zip code as if I gave her the wrong one (obviously they won't tell you it's wrong for security purposes) I said which one because I do not know which they had on file. The customer service rep responded as if I responded with I did not no my zip code. I repeated my answer that I did not know which zip code they hand on file now since the credit card changed with the last rep. She repeated the question, at this point I started to get terse as I started to feel like she had been doing this a thousand times and was not interested in listening to what I said. I repeat my answer in a stern voice that I did not know which credit card was on file at this point due to the fact that the card was charged with the previous customer service rep.  Silence on the lineâ€¦then music. I was put back into the queue. After about 30mins of being on hold the call rang though but I was put in the queue again probably by the same rep that I talked to who put me back in the queue. After another 30 mins of being on hold the call rang though and I was able to finally I speak to someone. She identified herself as Chasity.  I asked to speak to the head of that department or who she reported to,  she would not answer the question and kept repeating that she was the supervisor and that there was nobody higher than her, and could she help me. I released the call at this point.

I plan to call the corporate headquarters as soon as I get time.  I need to speak to some much higher up So I can explain that the quality of customer service is unacceptable.

I want 2 months free for having to spend two hours of my time and I want automated payment setup for sept and I don't want to be double charged for august from the automated system charging me for august since it was already paid for.

Your staff are not handling issues very well the automated payment should have been setup when the payment was taken and I should have not been asked to set this up myself.

There is no chain of command where you can escalate issues if you get a bad chain of employees when trying to get your issue handled. If you get a bad support rep. (and tmobile has many), you're screwed. It seems like from my experience that the reps. will just drop the call if you don't play ball with the way things are. Meaning that they just want you to repeat information so they don't have to do their job. They seem to deliberately misinterpret the call in such a way a to do the least amount of work to help.
